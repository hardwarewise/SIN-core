Check the transactions History of your wallet and your node will be up and running in less than 10 mins automatically after the confirmations.

  

It really is that simple. In just a few short clicks, would-be network participants will earn considerable passive income for up to a year. For community members who have previously set up an infinity node, SINOVATE setUP provides the perfect opportunity to reassess your VPS needs at a fraction of the cost.
